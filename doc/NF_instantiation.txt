title NF Instantiation

# This diagram outlines the basic use case of NF instance creation. Users come and configure new instances of NF (pointing to a specific Catalog entry) and Workload manager spawns the NF in the background.

User->Rest: NF-instance creation
note left of Rest: This is just an ordinary write\n to config space

Rest->Datastore: NF-instance write

Datastore->Workload Manager: NF-instance notification
note left of Workload Manager: Part of the NF-instance configuration \n is I-ID of a catalog entry for NF

Workload Manager->Datastore: NF-instance notification ACK

Workload Manager->Catalog: NF-catalog entry read

Catalog->Workload Manager: NF-catalog entry read status

Workload Manager->Driver Registry: NF Instantiation
note right of Driver Registry: Choose fitting driver \n // TODO how to choose the driver ?

Driver Registry->Driver: NF Instantiation request
note right of Driver Registry: Init response data

Driver->VIM: NF Instantiation request

VIM->Driver: NF Instantiation init return code

Driver->Driver Registry: NF Instantiation init response 

Driver Registry->Workload Manager: NF Instantiation init reponse

Workload Manager->Datastore: State data init
note left of Workload Manager: Initial op data write with value \n "initializing"

Datastore->Rest: NF instance status

Rest->User: NF instance status

loop
Workload Manager->Driver Registry: NF Instantiation status check
Driver Registry->Driver: NF Instantiation status check


Driver-> Driver Registry: NF Instantiation status response

Driver Registry->Workload Manager: NF Instantiation status response
end

loop
note right of Driver: Periodic check
Driver->VIM: NF Instantiation status query request 
VIM->Driver: NF Instantiation status query response
end

note right of Driver Registry: Upon success or failure 

Driver-> Driver Registry: NF Instantiation final response notification

Driver Registry->Workload Manager: NF Instantiation final response notification

Workload Manager->Datastore: State data update
note left of Workload Manager: Op data updated to state: \n "running" or "failed"

User->Rest: NF-instance status check

Rest->Datastore: NF-instance status check

Datastore->Rest: NF instance status response

Rest->User: NF instance status response
